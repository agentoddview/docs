<Steps>
  <Step title="Administration" icon="arrow-trend-up" iconType="regular" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h3">
    Handles Staff, Partnerships, Development, Operations

    - **Founder** (Ilias)
    - **Heads Of Operations** (Medy/Elwin),
    - **Chief Of Staff**  (Your Truly, Agent),
    - **Logistic Lead** (Jarek),
    - **Chief Of Transit Police** (Sondor),
    - **Lead Builder** (Cartel),
    - \*\*Lead Scripter \*\*(MMK)

      _(Important to say that the admin team works all on the same level, with their authority depending on what they run. Eg. Sondor over-ranks me if it pertains to TPD and he makes the final decision) (Still: Always listen to admins if they tell you to do something)_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Supervisory Team" icon="user-gear" iconType="regular" titleSize="h3">
    Handles moderation

    - **Lead Supervisor**  (1900, Cam),
    - **Senior Supervisor**

      _(Chain Of Command applies, if a supervisor is above you, you listen_)

    - **Detective**
    - **Police Officer**
