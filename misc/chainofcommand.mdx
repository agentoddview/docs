    Handles Staff, Partnerships, Development, Operations

    - **Founder** (Ilias)

    - **Head Of Transit Police** (Sondor)

      _(Important to say that the admin team works all on the same level, with their authority depending on what they run. Eg. Sondor over-ranks me if it pertains to TPD and he makes the final decision) (Still: Always listen to admins if they tell you to do something)_
