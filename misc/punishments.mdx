<Note>
  For actions that show "NO ACTION" for recommended punishment, those are rules that supervisors do not moderate. If you would like to take action against offenders, you should do so through roleplay as part of the Transit Police. If you issue warnings, kicks, or bans for any of the offenses below, you will be terminated.
