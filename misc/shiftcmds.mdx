It is fine to use these commands in any channel as they are only visible to you. (The announcement which will stay consistent in the shifts channel would be visible to everyone.)

### Announcing a shift

```
/shift game: time_str: routes: buses_on_duty:
```

<Tip>
  Make sure time is in Eastern Standard Time! You can also use the optional notes addon to add any info to your shift announcement.
</Tip>

### Canceling a shift

```
/cancelshift message_id_or_link:
```

<Tip>
  You can get the message ID by enabling developer mode, and then right clicking copy message ID on said original shift announcement.
</Tip>

### Stopping a shift

```
/shiftstop message_id_or_link:
```
