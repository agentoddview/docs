### What Adonis is, and How It Works

Adonis Admin is a popular admin system inside Roblox. It uses the colon (:) to run commands. It mainly follows the format from command, username, prompt. An example would be:

```
:track agentoddview true
```

**Not all commands follow this format.** Make sure you double check by using `:cmds`or run the custom Adonis menu. (More on that later.)

You can also shorten usernames. Please shorten it to the minimum of 4 letters. The reason why is when using 3, people can trick you into using strong commands such as all. An example would be:

```
:track agen true
```

Another trick you can use when doing mutliple specific players, is by using commas to seperate names in a single command. An example would be:

```
:kill noob1,noob2
```

Multiple variables for the player section can exist. The following includes:

| Player Command | Example             | Effects Player                          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Leave Blank    | `:fly`              | Effects yourself                        |
| `me`           | `:fly me`           | Effects yourself                        |
| `username`     | `:fly agentoddview` | Effects a specific player               |
| `all`          | `:fly all`          | Effects all players, _including you_    |
| `others`       | `:fly others`       | Effects all players, _excluding you_    |
| `admins`       | `:fly admins`       | Effects all admins                      |
| `nonadmins`    | `:fly nonadmins`    | Effects all players, _excluding admins_ |
| `random`       | `:fly random`       | Effects a random player                 |
| `#num`         | `:fly #3`           | Effects random players                  |
| `%team`        | `:fly %operators`   | Effects member of a team                |
| `$groupid`     | `:fly $13039250`    | Effects members of a group              |
| `radius-num`   | `:fly radius-5`     | Effects anyone in a raduis -stud of you |

Placing `-` before any selector or player name will _invert_ the selection and select everyone except those within the selection defined after `-`. To illustrate, using the `others` selector is essentially the same as doing `all,-me`. An example would be: (explodes all players further than 10 studs from yoU.)

```
:explode -radius-10
```
