### What Adonis is, and How It Works

Adonis Admin is a popular admin system inside Roblox. It uses the colon (:) to run commands. It mainly follows the format from command, username, prompt. An example would be:

```
:track agentoddview true
```

### Basic Adonis Mechanics

These are the following ways by which an Adonis command can be executed by a user:

- by chat (as long as chat commands have not been disabled)
- by command console (default keybind for opening the console is `'`; the console may be restricted or disabled according to settings)
- by other interfaces such as `:cmdbox`

In all cases, the prefix (which is `:` by default for admin commands and `!` by default for player commands) _must_ be included at the start of each command for it to work. /e also works to hide your commands.

<Warning>
  Make sure to always **hide your commands** by using the methods above. Failure to do this will result in a written warning / strike.
</Warning>

**Not all commands follow this format.** Make sure you double check by using `:cmds`or run the custom Adonis menu.

### Player Selectors

You can also shorten usernames. Please shorten it to the minimum of 4 letters. The reason why is when using 3, people can trick you into using strong commands such as all. An example would be:

```
:track agen true
```

<Warning>
  Make sure to always shorten it to the minimum of **4 letters for a username**. Anything less is prohibited, and can result in written warning / strike. The reason why we do this is to not risk using `all `unintentionally.
</Warning>

Another trick you can use when doing mutliple specific players, is by using commas to seperate names in a single command. An example would be:

```
:kill noob1,noob2
```

Multiple variables for the player section can exist. The following includes:

| Player Command | Example             | Effects Player                          |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Leave Blank    | `:fly`              | Effects yourself                        |
| `me`           | `:fly me`           | Effects yourself                        |
| `username`     | `:fly agentoddview` | Effects a specific player               |
| `all`          | `:fly all`          | Effects all players, _including you_    |
| `others`       | `:fly others`       | Effects all players, _excluding you_    |
| `admins`       | `:fly admins`       | Effects all admins                      |
| `nonadmins`    | `:fly nonadmins`    | Effects all players, _excluding admins_ |
| `random`       | `:fly random`       | Effects a random player                 |
| `#num`         | `:fly #3`           | Effects random players                  |
| `%team`        | `:fly %operators`   | Effects member of a team                |
| `$groupid`     | `:fly $13039250`    | Effects members of a group              |
| `radius-num`   | `:fly radius-5`     | Effects anyone in a raduis -stud of you |

Placing `-` before any selector or player name will _invert_ the selection and select everyone except those within the selection defined after `-`. To illustrate, using the `others` selector is essentially the same as doing `all,-me`. An example would be: (explodes all players further than 10 studs from yoU.)

```
:explode -radius-10
```

### Batch Commands

Multiple commands can be ran sequentially at a time by separating them using the batch key, which defaults to `|` (vertical pipe).

Additionally, you can insert timed delays using `!wait <duration in seconds>`.

**Example:** `:ff me | :m Exploding everyone in 10 seconds! | !wait 10 | :explode all` - gives you a forcefield and makes a message announcement, waits 10 seconds, then explodes everyone.

### General Commands

- `:kick <player> <reason>`
- `:bring <player>`
- `:track <player> <update?>`
- `:fly <player>`
- `:inslist`

Disconnects the specified player from the server. If specified, the reason is shown to the player.

### Banning Players

<Tip>
  Make sure to always follow the **warn 2-3 times, kick, then ban.**
</Tip>

- `:banlist`

  Displays a list of normal bans.
- `:timebanlist`

  Displays a list of time-banned users.
- `:ban/:serverban <player> <reason>`

  Bans the specified player from the current server. Note that they may still be able to join other servers.
- `:permban/:gameban <player> <reason>`

  Bans the specified player from _all_ game servers, for an indefinite amount of time. Enforced immediately, so if the user is in a server other than where the command is run, they will be kicked by the system.
- `:tempban/:timeban <player> <duration (s/m/h/d)> <reason>`

  Bans the specified player from _all_ game servers, for a specific amount of time. Enforced immediately.

**Example:** `:tempban Player1 3d` -- globally-bans Player1 for 3 days.

### Announcement Commands

Announcement commands are command which are sent through the server to all the players. Its important to use case for these.

- `:n <message>`

  Displays a normal sized announcement.

<Note>
  Don't use n for **unnessesary commands **that don't need to be used. Examples can include ":n Hello everyone! Your favorite supervisor is here!". Please dont. Keep it to a minimum, and always use it when needed.
</Note>

- `:m <message>`

  Displays a large sized announcement

<Danger>
  Make sure to **never **use the M command. It covers the entire screen,
</Danger>

- `:h <message>`

  Displays a screen sized banner for 5 seconds.
- `:setmessage <message>`

  Displays a screen sized banner until doing `:setmessage off`
