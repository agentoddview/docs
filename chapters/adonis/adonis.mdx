### What Adonis is, and How It Works

Adonis Admin is a popular admin system inside Roblox. It uses the colon (:) to run commands. It mainly follows the format from command, username, prompt. An example would be:

```
:track all true
```

**Not all commands follow this format.** Make sure you double check by using `:cmds`or run the custom Adonis menu. (More on that later.)

Multiple variables for the player section can exist. The following includes:
