### Purpose

This section defines unacceptable in-game behaviour within NET’s Roblox games (such as Boston Bus Simulator and New England Bus Simulator) and outlines how we respond with disciplinary action. It is designed to ensure a fair, welcoming and professional-level environment for all players — drivers, passengers, staff, and visitors alike.

### Scope

These rules apply to all in-game activity under NET’s games and servers, including:

- Gameplay via the Roblox engine in NET-published games
- In-game chat (text or voice) within those games
- Interactions with staff, other players, or community events tied to NET’s games
- Roleplay functions (driving, dispatching, passenger service) as well as free-drive or event-modes

### Categories of Violation

Here are the major categories of misconduct in-game:

1. **Harassment & Abusive Communication**
   - Insults, slurs, hate speech, targeted bullying of other players or staff.
   - Repeated disruptive chat/voice behaviour meant to annoy, degrade or intimidate.
   - Use of voice/text to harass, troll or demean others.
2. **Disruptive Gameplay / Griefing**
   - Intentionally sabotaging your own team or other players’ experience.
   - Willfully refusing to participate in game objectives (e.g., in role-play tasks) so as to frustrate others.
   - Abusing free-drive or event systems to derail normal gameplay.
3. **Cheating, Exploits & Moderation Evasion**
   - Use of any third-party software, scripts or tools to gain unfair advantage.
   - Deliberately exploiting bugs, glitches, or map defects to win or disrupt.
   - Attempting to bypass bans/mutes, using alternate accounts, or using chat/voice to evade filters.
4. **Misuse of Staff/Roleplay Tools**
   - When acting in a staff/official capacity, using those privileges to dominate, harass or exploit other players.
   - Using roles, commands or features you should not have access to, especially in transit role-play context.

### Punishment Framework

The severity of the action taken depends on **the violation type**, **its impact**, **intent**, and **a player’s history**. We follow a progressive model, but serious first-time offences may also receive strong sanctions.

| Level                               | Typical Action                                                          | Description                                                                                     |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Warning                             | Written or verbal in-game warning                                       | For first‐time minor or borderline offences                                                     |
| Temporary Mute / Chat Restriction   | Restrict chat or voice access for a defined period                      | For moderate offences (repeated harassment, mild griefing)                                      |
| Temporary Suspension / Game Ban     | Temporary ban from game/server for a defined length                     | For serious offences or recurrent behaviours (cheating, major griefing)                         |
| Permanent Ban / Account Termination | Permanent removal of game access (and possibly Roblox group privileges) | For the worst violations: major cheating, hate behaviour, impersonation of staff, repeated bans |

> _Note:_ The exact durations (hours/days/weeks) and scope (single game vs network-wide) will be determined by moderators and administrators.

### Procedure for Moderators

- Gather and document evidence (chat logs, game replay, timestamps, screenshots) before applying major action.
- Attempt to **educate first**: communicate to the player what they did wrong, why it’s wrong, and how they can avoid doing it again.
- Use discretion: some incidents may call for immediate suspension (e.g., major cheating) while others benefit from warnings and correction.
- Escalate when necessary: repeat offenders or evasion (alternate accounts) move up the ladder faster.

### Appeals & Review

Players who believe their punishment was applied unfairly may submit an appeal. The appeal must include:

- Username, date/time of incident, description of what happened
- What rule they believe was mis-applied
- Any evidence or context for the decision\
  Appeals are reviewed by senior moderators or admin panel. The decision may uphold, reduce, or remove the punishment.

### Additional Notes

- These in-game rules complement NET’s larger community policies (e.g., Discord rules) and the Roblox Terms of Service.
- Behaviour that violates real-world laws (e.g., threats of violence, hate crimes) will be escalated outside the game and may lead to removal from the community entirely.
- NET’s brand and reputation matter: in our transit-simulation setting, we encourage players to act responsibly, reflect the theme of realistic transit operations, and help maintain a professional community.

### Revision & Updates

This policy and the associated punishment table will be reviewed periodically to reflect new game features, evolving community norms, and updated moderation practices. Any changes will be communicated on the sdocs site and in the announcements channel.
