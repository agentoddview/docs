###  In-Game Punishment Violations

### Purpose

This section defines unacceptable in-game behaviour, identifies violation categories and outlines corresponding punishments for players under the jurisdiction of NETransit. These rules are intended to maintain a safe, respectful, and fair playing environment for all participants.

### Scope

These rules apply to all players within our in-game ecosystem (including voice/text chat, game actions, match-making, spectator behaviour, role-play sessions, events) as managed by NETransit. Moderators and administrators will enforce these standards and apply punishments based on severity and recurrence.

### Violation Categories

We categorise in-game misconduct into the following major types:

1. **Harassment & Abusive Communication**
   - Insults, slurs, hate speech, targeted harassment of other players or staff.
   - Repeated disruptive chat behaviour, trolling, excessive profanity, threats.
   - Use of voice chat or text to degrade, demean or intimidate another.
2. **Disruptive Gameplay / Griefing**
   - Intentionally sabotaging one’s own team or another’s experience.
   - Exploiting game mechanics, abusing tools we did not intend to be abused.
   - Refusing to participate in game objectives with aim to frustrate others.
3. **Cheating, Exploits & Bypassing Moderation**
   - Use of third-party software or tools to gain unfair advantage.
   - Exploiting bugs or glitches deliberately to disrupt or win unfairly.
   - Circumventing bans/mutes, using alternate accounts, evading punishments.
   - Altering chat/voice to evade filters or moderation systems.
4. **Role-Play / Community Role Abuse (if applicable)**
   - Breaking role-play immersion rules in ways that compromise other players’ experience.
   - Using roles, commands or tools granted to you in-game to unfairly dominate, harass or exploit others.
   - Misusing administrative or moderator tools when given temporary elevated privileges.

### Punishment Framework

The punishment we apply is determined by **severity**, **frequency**, and **context** of the violation. Typically we follow a progressive discipline model, but severe first-time offences may merit escalated action. Check the punishment table in quick reference for more info.

Generic Rule of Thumb

| Level                               | Typical Action                                                   | Description                                                                     |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Warning                             | Verbal or written warning                                        | For minor first-time violations or borderline behaviour.                        |
| Temporary Mute / Chat Restriction   | Mute or restrict chat/voice for a period                         | For repeated chat infractions, disruptive communication, mild griefing.         |
| Temporary Suspension / Game Ban     | Temporary ban from participating in game(s) or server(s)         | For moderately severe violations or repeated offences.                          |
| Permanent Ban / Account Termination | Removal of all access under that account (possibly network-wide) | For major violations: cheating, hate behavior, extreme griefing, repeated bans. |

### Moderator & Player Procedures

- When a violation is flagged, moderators will review evidence (chat logs, game replays, account history) and apply the appropriate action.
- Players will receive a notification of the action, the violation category, and any right of appeal (if applicable).
- In cases of repeat offenders or multi-account evasion, escalating consequences apply.
- Players found to be falsely claiming moderation actions are unfair may themselves face punishment (e.g., for harassing or defaming staff).

### Appeal Process

Players who believe a punishment was applied in error can submit an appeal via our support channel. Appeals should include any relevant evidence (screenshots, timestamps, account info) and will be reviewed by a senior moderator or admin panel. The reviewing body may uphold, reduce or remove the punishment.

### Additional Notes

- They are internal policy for the NETransit community.
- Behaviour that violates local laws (e.g., threats of violence, hate crimes) may be reported to law enforcement and may lead to more severe consequences than our in-game system.
- We emphasise transparency: when possible, we provide explanation of moderation decisions to affected players (which is widely recognised as good practice in online moderation). 
- Our goal is to **educate** and **correct** behaviour, not just punish. The system is designed to encourage positive community engagement.

### Revision & Updates

This document and the Punishment Table will be periodically reviewed, and may be updated to respond to new patterns of behaviour, evolving game mechanics, or community feedback. Any changes will be posted on this site with a revision date and summary of changes.
