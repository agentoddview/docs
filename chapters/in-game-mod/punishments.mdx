### Purpose

This document is intended for supervisors and moderators within the New England Transit (NET) Roblox ecosystem, to explain how to identify, evaluate and apply punishments for in-game violations. It builds on our community rules and ensures consistent, fair, and transparent enforcement.

#### Scope

Applies to all in-game spaces under NET’s purview (e.g., official game servers, role-play events, transit simulation sessions), including:

- Text or voice chat inside games
- Player behaviour (drivers, passengers, staff roles)
- Use of staff privileges or role-play tools\
  Supervisors must be ready to act when infractions occur and apply the framework in coordination with senior staff.

#### Supervisor Responsibilities

- Monitor behaviour proactively (observing chatter, gameplay, event-rooms).
- **Document**: record logs/screenshots/game-replays that illustrate the violation (use timestamp, player handle, location/event). Good documentation supports both fairness and appeals.
- **Coach first**: Whenever possible, issue a constructive warning, explaining what was wrong, why it’s wrong, and how the player can avoid repeating it. As training material suggests, helping moderators shift from simply punishing to educating improves long-term culture.
- **Escalate appropriately**: Use the punishment framework (below) while factoring severity, intent, harm, and prior history.

#### Violation Categories

Supervisors should familiarise themselves with these major categories:

1. **Harassment & Abusive Communication**
   - Targeted insults, slurs, hate speech, threats directed at other players or staff
   - Repeated disruptive chat/voice behaviour
2. **Disruptive Gameplay / Griefing**
   - Intentionally undermining team or other players’ experience
   - Exploiting game mechanics to frustrate others
3. **Cheating, Exploits & Evasion**
   - Use of third-party software/scripts
   - Exploiting bugs/glitches for advantage
   - Banning evasion (alternate accounts, filter bypass)
4. **Misuse of Staff Role / Role-play Tools**
   - A staff member abusing privileges to dominate or harass
   - Role-play commands/tools used improperly (e.g., service drivers refusing duty as prank)

#### Punishment Framework for Supervisors

| Level                                     | Supervisor Action                                   | Notes                                                                                   |
| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1: Warning                          | Inform the player, document the warning             | Use for minor/first-time infractions. Coaching emphasis.                                |
| Level 2: Temporary Chat/Voice Restriction | Apply mute or limit access for defined period       | Use for repeated infractions or moderate disruption.                                    |
| Level 3: Temporary Suspension / Game Ban  | Remove access for set duration                      | Use for serious offences or repeated escalations.                                       |
| Level 4: Permanent Ban                    | Remove access (and/or group privileges) permanently | Use for egregious offences: major cheating, harassment, impersonation, repeat violator. |

**Supervisor tip**: When applying any higher-level sanction (levels 3-4), prepare a “case brief” summarising logs, previous warnings, player history, and the rationale for escalation (helps with appeals and transparency).

#### Review & Appeal Procedure

- After sanction, notify the player: clearly state the violation, the applied punishment, and how they can improve.
- Provide information on how they may appeal: include contact method, what evidence to submit, and timeline.
- Supervisors should flag serious cases to senior admin (e.g., abuse of staff role) for double-check.
- If appeal is upheld, supervisor records the reversal or mitigation and notes lessons learned for future training.

#### Supervisory Best Practices

- **Be calm and consistent** — As one training guide notes, supervisors often face a mix of situations; maintaining a professional demeanour helps.
- **Use coaching language** — When issuing a warning, frame it as “helping you improve” rather than “you did wrong.”
- **Avoid public drama** — If an incident is complex or heated, move the discussion to private (DM) rather than creating spectacle in public channels (which training experts warn can fuel more drama).
- **Document everything** — Use logs, maintain internal incident tracker, share with senior staff if needed.
- **Train moderators regularly** — Supervisors should schedule reviews of cases, share examples of best/worst handling, and promote peer-learning among the moderation team.

#### Policy Updates

- This supervisor training guide will be reviewed at least annually, or sooner if major game changes or community behaviour shifts occur.
- Supervisors will be notified via staff channels and training sessions when updates are made.
