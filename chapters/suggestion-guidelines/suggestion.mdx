Supervise tickets and make sure they stay on topic and respectful. Lock tickets if they don't adhere to the set rules (<u>DO NOT DELETE THE THREAD)</u>

**Users should not do any of the following:**

- Not suggest new fleet that the MBTA, WRTA, or other contracted companies (Yankee Lines/Massport, Paul Revere, etc) do not use

(e.g. The MBTA doesn’t use NovaBuses, thus will not be added)

- Not suggest new routes, we already have a roadmap planned out for routing (e.g. Routes already planned)
- Not suggest fictional places
- Shouldn't suggest something if someone else already has and been approved or denied, Kindly remind them its been suggested and lock the post (e.g. BYD Buses have already been rejected
- Shouldn't suggest something like civilian cars or functional businesses, there are other games for that
- Not send bug reports here, those go under the ⁠bug-reports channel
- Shouldn’t suggest trained driving, we do not plan on having Lower Mystic at any point be a trained driving game
- Not suggest new games, we will plan those out
