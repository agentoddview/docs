### Ticket Guidelines

This information is also available in the #s-info channel.

When a ticket is created, you **MUST CLAIM** the ticket in order to speak or take action inside of it.\
This ensures accountability and prevents multiple staff members from giving conflicting responses.

If a ticket is already claimed, **do not** begin talking or interrupting unless permission has been given by the ticket owner or the supervisor who claimed it.\
To speak, you must first ask for “**PTS**” (Permission To Speak). Once permission is granted, you may respond.\
HR staff have global permission to break PTS when needed for oversight or escalation.

Only **Supervisors** have the explicit authority to respond to tickets.\
Developers, Transit Police, or other staff are not responsible for handling tickets unless given direct authorization by an Administrator.\
Supervisors are expected to respond quickly, professionally, and respectfully to all open tickets.

If a ticket involves **Donator Perks**, the user must present valid proof (screenshot or other clear evidence) that they purchased the correct Game-Pass.\
Make sure the proof is legitimate and not altered or photoshopped.\
If the image quality is low, ask follow-up questions or request the user to join in-game so you can verify their purchase directly.\
If you are not 100% sure, **ask an Administrator** for assistance before approving or denying the request.

All tickets must contain **clear, verifiable evidence** to support any report or claim.\
Tickets that lack proper evidence must be **denied**.\
Always remain professional — never make assumptions or take action without documentation.

When accepting a player report, always include the **Ticket Number** in the warning log for recordkeeping.\
Format it clearly as follows:\
`[Ticket ####] warning reason`

It is highly recommended that Supervisors keep their Discord status set to **“Online”** or check the NET Discord frequently.\
Failing to respond to open tickets or ignoring ticket pings repeatedly is grounds for **suspension**.
