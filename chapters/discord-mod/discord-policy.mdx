#### Purpose

This guide is for supervisors and moderators in our Discord server for NET. It outlines how to lead the moderation team, make consistent decisions, de-escalate conflicts, and maintain a positive and safe community space.

#### Scope

Covers all public and staff channels, voice rooms, bot/everyday interactions on the NET server, including events, game-discussion, staff-discussion, announcement channels. All moderators and supervisors are responsible for enforcement and training of other staff.

#### Supervisor Responsibilities

- Lead by example: maintain professional tone in voice/text, avatar/name appropriateness, etc.
- Provide training to new moderators: onboarding on rules, escalation paths, documentation standards.
- Monitor moderator actions: review logs, spot-check decisions to ensure consistency and fairness.
- Facilitate de-escalation: intervene early when public chat becomes heated; encourage resolution in private to avoid public drama.
- Maintain transparent documentation: use moderation log channel for high-level overview of actions, escalate when necessary.

#### Community Conduct Expectations (for Supervisors to Enforce)

Supervisors should ensure moderators uphold these core principles:

- **Respect & Decency** — All users treated kindly; no exceptions. Avatars and nicknames appropriate; no extremist or offensive imagery.
- **Appropriate Content** — PG-13 environment; no NSFW, slurs, hate speech, or personal data sharing. Spam, copypasta or unsolicited advertising prohibited.
- **Voice & Event Behaviour** — In voice channels: moderate volume, no mic-spam, respect host’s direction. For events: moderators should monitor chat, step in if discussions derail.
- **Staff Impersonation & Role Abuse** — Enforce rule: no one may impersonate staff; elevated roles must not be abused. Moderators should not threaten “If you do again, you’re banned” — instead issue warnings, then act if needed. (See guideline: “Don’t say you’ll act, just act.”)
- **Typeface & Nickname Standards** — Supervisors should enforce simple, readable nicknames; disallow obscure/unlegible fonts or excessive symbols (per screenshot rule).

#### Moderation Escalation Framework

| Level                                 | Supervisor/Moderator Action                                           | Notes                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1: Reminder                     | Moderator issues a friendly note publicly or privately                | For minor rule-breaches (e.g., off-topic post, minor nickname issue)                            |
| Level 2: Formal Warning               | Moderator logs warning and notifies user                              | For repeated minor issues or moderate rule-breach (e.g., moderate profanity, mild harassment)   |
| Level 3: Temporary Restriction / Mute | Restrict text or voice access for a defined period                    | For more serious issues (voice channel abuse, disruptive event behaviour)                       |
| Level 4: Kick / Temporary Ban         | Remove user from server for a period                                  | For serious offences: harassment, hate speech, sharing personal data, raids                     |
| Level 5: Permanent Ban                | Remove user permanently (and possibly impact Roblox group privileges) | For worst offences: impersonation of staff, repeated serious violations, large-scale disruption |

#### Supervisory Best Practices

- **Document all decisions**: Use a moderation log sheet. Include user, channel, timestamp, screenshot/log, staff decision, prior history.
- **Use private DM for de-escalation**: When issues escalate in a public channel, move to DM or private voice. This avoids amplifying the conflict and is best practice for moderation.
- **Coach moderators**: Supervisors should run periodic “case review” sessions: review recent moderation decisions, what went well, what could improve.
- **Ensure consistency**: Moderators must apply rules fairly and uniformly — one of the biggest pitfalls for supervisors is inconsistent enforcement. [ERC+1](https://yourerc.com/training/supervisor/ultimate-guide-to-training-supervisors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Feedback loop**: Supervisors solicit input from moderators about rule-gaps, new types of abuse emerging, games/voice trends. Use this to update policies.
- **Continuous training**: Use bite-sized refresher trainings, scenario-based role-play (e.g., “What do you do if user floods voice chat during stream?”). Training resources support better moderator outcomes. [SupportZebra](https://supportzebra.com/blog/guide-to-training-content-moderators-for-success?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

#### Appeals & Review Process

- When a user appeals a moderator action: Supervisors review the case (with logs, prior warnings, moderator notes).
- Determine outcome: uphold, reduce, or overturn sanction. Record the decision and reasoning.
- If overturned: update moderator team about the case so learning is shared.
- Use appeals data for recurring patterns: If many appeals in one moderator’s decisions, provide additional training or review policy interpretation.

#### Linking Discord & In-Game Systems

- Supervisors must understand the connection: Discord behaviour can impact in-game status and vice versa. Documented infractions in one may influence the other.
- For joint incidents (e.g., in-game abuse reported in Discord): supervisors coordinate with in-game moderation team to ensure consistent handling, avoid duplicate/unfair sanctions.

#### Policy Review & Updates

- Supervisors should schedule review of moderation policy at least yearly (or when major game or community changes occur).
- After each review: update the policy document version, publish to staff channel, run a refresher training session for all moderators.
