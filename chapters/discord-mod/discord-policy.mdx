This section defines expectations for conduct within the official NET Discord server, outlines how our staff will moderate, and clarifies the procedures for discipline and appeals. Because NET is both a game developer and transit-roleplay community, our Discord serves as the hub for announcements, staff communications, member chat, role-play coordination, and events — so a clear moderation framework is essential.

### Scope

These rules apply to all channels and voice rooms of NET’s official Discord server (text chat, voice chat, media sharing, announcements, events). They also cover any endorsed community servers or voice rooms where NET staff act as moderators.

Applicable to:

- All members: staff, moderators, guests, visitors
- Channels for announcements, game discussion, staff-only chat, voice event rooms, etc.
- Linked game sessions or event rooms where staff oversee behaviour

### Community Conduct Expectations

To foster a positive environment, all users should abide by the following:

1. **Respect & Decency**
   - Treat all users with courtesy and kindness — no exceptions. (Screenshot rule: “Please respect all users within the server. There are 0 exceptions.”)
   - Avatars, nicknames, and profiles must be appropriate. Do not use extremist imagery, hate symbols, obscene content or mis-represent staff roles.
   - Avoid illegible or disruptive typefaces; only use normal characters in nicknames.
2. **Appropriate Content**
   - The server is PG-13; NSFW, extreme gore, slurs, hate-speech or illegal content is prohibited. This includes voice/text/image channels. (See notice: “NSFW content is not allowed in any section of the server.”)
   - Spam (including copypasta), unsolicited advertising, phishing links or disruptive posting is not tolerated.
   - Media you share must be appropriate for the community and compliant with Discord TOS and Roblox TOS.
3. **Voice & Event Behaviour**
   - In voice channels: use respectful tone, avoid mic-spam, background noise, interrupting or shouting.
   - During events (game streams, meet-ups, Q&As, staff meetings): follow the host/moderator’s instructions and stay on topic.
   - If main chat becomes heated, moderators should de-escalate (move offenders to DM, not always public). (See guideline: “Be professionals at de-escalation … don’t use a cooldown to fix it.”)
4. **Staff Impersonation & Role Abuse**
   - Do not impersonate staff, moderators or NET official roles.
   - If you have elevated role (trial moderator, event host), do not abuse those privileges: no harassment, no misuse of commands, no unapproved bans/kicks.
   - Members should not threaten bans or misuse authority; moderators should “act” not merely “say” (“just ban them” not “say I’ll ban you”).

### Moderation Actions & Escalation

Moderation in Discord follows a structured escalation model; each case is assessed on severity, prior history, and impact.

| Level                       | Typical Action                                                | Description                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Friendly Reminder           | Moderator gives a verbal or written note                      | For minor first-time issues (e.g., off-topic post, slight misuse of typeface)                         |
| Formal Warning              | Private or public warning logged                              | For repeated minor issues or first moderate offence (e.g., moderate profanity, borderline harassment) |
| Temporary Restriction/Mute  | Restrict text/voice access for a period                       | For more serious offences: voice abuse, repeated harassment, disruption of events                     |
| Temporary Suspension / Kick | Expel from server for defined period                          | For serious offences: harassment, hate speech, personal data sharing, raiding                         |
| Permanent Ban               | Remove Discord access (and potentially game/group privileges) | For major violations: impersonation of staff, large-scale disruption, repeated severe rule-breaking   |

**Note for moderators:**

- Always attempt de-escalation: “Treat everyone with kindness and respect… You’re almost always dealing with an immature kid. Give them chances to learn.”
- Use at least **2-3 warnings** for moderate/disruptive language (e.g., excessive swearing) before escalating to ban.
- If the situation is heated in public, move the conversation into a DM with the offender rather than creating public drama.

### Member Rights & Appeals

- If you receive a moderation action and believe it was unfair, you may appeal via our support channel. Provide your username, time/date of incident, your view of what happened, and any evidence.
- Appeals will be reviewed by senior moderators or administrators (at least two). They may uphold, reduce or overturn the action.
- During the appeal process, the original action normally remains in effect unless explicitly stated.

### Linking to Roblox / NET Activities

- Behaviour in Discord may affect your in-game status, staff roles, or NET group privileges — and vice versa.
- In-game misconduct can be reported via Discord and may carry over into game bans or Roblox group discipline.
- Do not use Discord to coordinate or plan exploitative behaviour in the games (cheating, mass-reporting, etc.). Such activity is subject to discipline in both Discord and the game.

### Policy Revisions & Updates

As NET evolves (with new games, events, community growth) our Discord moderation policy will be updated. Changes will be announced in the server’s announcements channel and versioned accordingly.
