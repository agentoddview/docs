### Quota and Announcing

Shifts are hosted **<u>AT LEAST 3 hours</u> **in advance and **<u>AT LEAST 6 hours</u> **_after_ the end of a previous run.

**<u>PLEASE</u> **ensure there is **<u>AT LEAST</u> **1 run per 1 week.

Use the command /shift with the New England Transit bot to announce a shift.

_It is fine to use these commands in any channel as they are only visible to you. (The announcement which will stay consistent in the shifts channel would be visible to everyone.)_

There are 3 commands for shifts

- `/shift`
- `/cancelshift`
- `/shiftstop`

_Use these commands to announce shifts, cancel them, and stop them after their done._

### How to start a shift server

You may know that you use netransit.net/shift or /joinshift to join shifts. These both essentially makes you join the MBTA Shift hub. After you join the hub, it can redirect you to the reserved server that the game is being hosted in.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use traditional methods to join hub" stepNumber={1}>
    Eithier through the link or command in the hub, use those to join the shift hub. You will know once you see this screen.

    You may notice the bright blue button that reads "Start Shift". This only appears for supervisors, and once clicked loads a new server. This screen will show to normal players if no shift is started, just without the button.
