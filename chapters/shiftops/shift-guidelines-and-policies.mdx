### Quota and Announcing

Shifts are hosted **<u>AT LEAST 3 hours</u> **in advance and **<u>AT LEAST 6 hours</u> **_after_ the end of a previous run.

**<u>PLEASE</u> **ensure there is **<u>AT LEAST</u> **1 run per 1 week.

Use the command /shift with the New England Transit bot to announce a shift.

_It is fine to use these commands in any channel as they are only visible to you. (The announcement which will stay consistent in the shifts channel would be visible to everyone.)_
